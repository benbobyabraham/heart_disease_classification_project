# Predicting Heart Disease

## Problem Statement
Analyze the data set and identify most relevant heart disease related risk factors as well as predict the overall risk.

## Workflow
1. Perform exploratory analysis on the data and describe your understanding of the data.
2. Perform data wrangling / pre-processing
a.       E.g., missing data, normalization, discretization, etc.
3. Apply any two feature selection engineering techniques
4. Compare the two selected feature engineering techniques.
5. Plot top 5, 6, and 8 features.
6. Provide a high-level description of Machine Learning models – Logistic regression and Decision tree, ANN to predict.
7. Compare the performance of the two classifiers – Logistic regression and Decision tree to predict.
